Win32::Event2Log

=head1 description

This module uses L<Win32::EventLog> and parses windows events and write them to plain logfiles.
This module is rule based: a rule it's a minimal set of conditions to be met to write an entry to a logfile.
You must add valid rules before starting the engine.
Once started, the engine will check events every x seconds (specified using C<interval> argument)
and for every registry (System, Application, Security, Installation or a user defined one) that is requested
at least in one rule will check for an event's source specified and optionally for some text contained in the
event's description. If the rule it's succesfull then an entry it's wrote in the specified logfile.
A custom callback can transofrm the line to be wrote using the C<format> option.
The parser can optionally shutdown itself if C<endtime> it is specified.

=head1 methods

=head2 new

This is the constructor of the engine. It can accept options and if not provided sets some default.
C<interval> it's the frequency expressed in seconds between two reads of events. 
It's merely implemented sleeping so if many events have to be written to many different logfiles 
the next event read can happen a bit later than C<interval>. It defaults to 5 seconds.

C<computer> specify which machine will be interrogated to read events. It is infact possible to
read events from remote systems for example in a domain environment. It defaults to the local
system as found in the environment variable C<$ENV{COMPUTERNAME}>

C<endtime> lets you to specify when the engine will stops. It defaults to 0 meaning never.
If you set C< endtime =E<gt> time + 3600> the engine will run just an hour. If you want, for example, the
engine to stop at midnight it's up to you to specify seconds since epoch of the next midnight.

The C<verbosity> option can vary from 0 (almost no output) to 3 (which will dump also events that match
a rule and many other things). It defaults to 0 as the engine is meant to be run as scheduled task or at
system startup. If C<mainlog> it is specified C<verbosity> will be automatically set to 1 if it was 0 meaning
you want some output in the logfile if you specified one.

In C<mainlog> file will be redirected all the engine output. If you do not specify a file and the C<verbosity>
it is greater than 0 the name of the calling program with C<-history.log> appended to it will be used and the
file will be in the current directory.

The C<lastreadfile> is where the engine will look to know which last event id, for every registry, was already
read in the past. If this file does not exist the engine will start reading events since the oldest one until
the more recent one. This file contains a record for every registry separately.
In this file the engine will write ids of last event read at every iteration to be sure that a shutdown of the 
system or a kill of the process will do not lead to incorrect behaviour of the engine on next run.
If no file name is specified the name of the calling program with C<-lastread.log> appended to it will be used
and the file will be in the current directory.



=head2 add_rule

This is the method to be used to add rules to the engine. Infact an engine without rules is unuseful at all.
If an event matches a rule it will be written to the appropriate logfile,
A rule construction accept many arguments: C<registry source log> are mandatory, while other are optional.

C<registry> is the event registry (C<System> or C<Application> for example) where the rule is applied. This 
argument must be specified literraly with the correct case for the first character. Please note that, fortunately, if
your system has not the english locale internally the registry is always C<System> and not the localized format
shown in the graphical interface of the Event Viewer.

C<source> it is the event source that must match for the rule to be successful. C<source> accepts a string or a 
compiled regex passed as in C< qr/^kernel/i > for example. This lets you to have more sources matched by a single
rule and this is useful because many sources are related. Even if a string it is passed will be internally compiled
into a regex and as regex will be shown in the configuration.

C<log> is the filename where events that matched the rule will be written. Note that the same file can be used
in different rules if this make sense for you. Infact the file will be opened in append mode and closed everytime
an entry has to be added to it. This is inteded to prevent some buffering the operating system is known to apply 
sometimes if the file is left open. 

C<name> it is the optional name you want to assign to the rule. If you do not specify a name a default, progressive
name containing the registry too will be created for you.

C<eventtype> it's an option to filter types of event. Internally types are numerical fields with the following meanings:
C< 1 'Error', 2 'Warning', 4 'Information', 8 'Success_Audit', 16 'Failure_Audit'>
Anyway for your lazyness you can specify them as lowercase strings separated by C<|> or as a regex and then
internally will be transformed into a regex using numerical values.
So C< eventtype => 'error|warning'> is the same of C< eventtype => 'Error|Warning'> and of C< eventtype => qr/^1|2$/>

C<regex> it is an option to filter just events which message text matches what you want. It can be passed as compiled regex
or as string but internally will be compiled as regex. It defaults to C< qr/./ >

An optional callback can be passed with the option C<format> and will be used to format the line written to the logfile.
In this callback the object representing the event will be received as first argument.
The callback must return a string to be written. So you can grab and transform each event fields at your will.
Note also that you can use the C<Win32::Event2Log::num_to_eventtype> function inside your callback to have back a meaningful string instead
of a bare number for the type of the event.
Events fields are: C<Computer User TimeGenerated Strings RecordNumber Data Timewritten Message EventID Source Category Length ClosingRecordNumber EventType>
or at least these are those exposed by L<Win32::EventLog> 
See L<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363646(v=vs.85).aspx> for further informations.
The C<format> option defaults to the following code:

	sub{
		my $ev = shift;
		if (defined $ev->{Message} ){
			$ev->{Message} =~ s/\n/ /g;
		}
		else{$ev->{Message} = '-no message defined-'}
		return  scalar localtime($ev->{TimeGenerated})."\t".
				$ev->{Source}."\t".
				Win32::Event2Log::num_to_eventtype($ev->{EventType})."\t".
				$ev->{Message}."\n";
	};


=head2 start

This is the method to start the engine. It just fails if no rule are defined. It runs the engine forever or until an
C<endtime> as specified in the engine configuration.

=head2 show_conf

This method can be used to nicely dump the current engine configuration and all rules.
It is used internally to print the configuration before starting reading events if C<verbosity> is set to 1 or more.



=head1 examples

=head3 a simple one

Bilel is a Linux system administrator experienced with grep and ack but at work he has a windows10 client.
He notices strange system errors and after had spent an hour searching the Event Viewer he decides to automate
the export of all errors and warnings of the System registry to a plain log file to analyze it with command
line tools he already masters. He write the following program:

	use strict;
	use warnings;

	use Win32::Event2Log;

	my $main_log = $0.'.mainlog.log';
	my $last_numbers_log = $0.'.last_numbers.log';
	my $sys_errors_log = $0.'.System_err_warn.log';


	my $engine = Win32::Event2Log->new(	
				interval 	=> 60,
				endtime 	=> 0,
				mainlog 	=> $main_log,	
				verbosity	=> 2,
				lastreadfile=> $last_numbers_log,		
	);

	$engine->add_rule (
				registry => 'System',
				eventtype=> 'error|warning',
				source	 => qr/./,
				log		 => $sys_errors_log, 
				name 	 => 'System errors and warnings',			
	);

	$engine->start;

He launchs the above program and he sees just one line in the console stating that
all the output was redirected to the main log specified in the engine constructor.

He open the above file to review the rule configuration and he sees:

	rule  'System errors and warnings' for the registry System:

	eventtype     (?^:1|2)
	log           event2log-test01.pl.System_err_warn.log
	regex         (?^:.)
	source        (?^:.)
	format        $VAR1 = \sub {
				  package Win32::Event2Log;
				  use warnings;
				  use strict;
				  my $ev = shift();
				  if (defined $ev->{'Message'}) {
					  $ev->{'Message'} =~ s/\n/ /g;
				  }
				  else {
					  $ev->{'Message'} = '-no message defined-';
				  }
				  return scalar localtime($ev->{'TimeGenerated'}) . "\t" . $ev->{'Source'} . "\t" . num_to_eventtype($ev->{'EventType'}) . "\t" . $ev->{'Message'} . "\n";
			  };


All is as expected. He also notices that 1586 events were already read and 14 were wrote 
to the destination log and that the engine checks for new events every 60 seconds.

After some time he shutdowns the client and wonders what will happen whith his logs. He launchs
again the above program and opening the main log he is happy noticing the program started
reading from event 1587  and appended new events correctly to his file. He schedules the program
to run at startup and forget about it.


=head3 a more complex one

Lidia is a Perl programmer used to work in Win32 environments. She was tasked to secure a MSSQL server
against brute force attacks. She wrote a nice program similar to fail2ban in Perl that adds temporary
rules to the local firewall. She though needs a plain logfile to itercept failed MSSQL logins and the
source IPs of the attempts. She has enough experience to know that even if such attempts are shown as
information, with the information icon, in the Event Viewer, they really are 'Failure Audit' ones.

She also wants her logfiles to be daily, so she wants her program to stop at 23:59 

She arranges the following program:

	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use DateTime;
	use Win32::Event2Log;

	my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime(time);
	my $daily_string = ($year + 1900).'-'.(sprintf '%02d',$mon + 1).'-'.(sprintf '%02d',$mday).'.log';

	my $next_end_of_day = DateTime->new(
		year       => $year + 1900,
		month      => $mon + 1,
		day        => $mday,
		hour       => 23,
		minute     => 59,
		second     => 59,
		time_zone  => 'Europe/Rome',
	);

	print "$0 scheduled to stop at ",(scalar localtime ($next_end_of_day->epoch)),"\n",
			"daily logfile is $daily_string\n";


	my $main_log = $0.'.mainlog.log';
	my $last_numbers_log = $0.'.last_numbers.log';
	my $mssql_log = $0.'-'.$daily_string;

She runs the above program and sees the logfile growing up to 4Mb. She also schedules the program to run at startup.

=head3 working with exotic registries

Barbara needs to inspect a strange misbehaviour in an application that writes entries in it's own
registry mapped under 'Application and Services' in the Event Viewer.
The program in this particular case is the 'AnyWhereConnect Secure Mobility Client' a VPN client
she uses to connect to the work client from the desert island she inhabits since years.
She knows that even if shown in a tree view, in the Event Viewer, all registries live in the folder
named C<%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\> 
Barbara discover at first glance in the Event Viewer that such evnts have not a Message field and
the data is in the Strings field instead.
She is aware that network guys will be not able to mount a custom registry to do the inspection
so she decides to send them a plain logfile obtained with the following program:

	use strict;
	use warnings;

	use Win32::Event2Log;

	my $main_log = $0.'.mainlog.log';
	my $last_numbers_log = $0.'.last_numbers.log';
	my $sys_errors_log = $0.'.AnyWhereConnect_err_and_warn.log';

	my $engine = Win32::Event2Log->new( endtime => time + 60 );

	$engine->add_rule (
				registry => 'AnyWhereConnect Secure Mobility Client',
				eventtype=> 'error|warning',
				source   => qr/./,
				# regex it is checked against Message but
				# this registry has them empty
				regex	 => qr/.?/,
				log      => $sys_errors_log, 
				name     => 'AnyWhereConnect errors and warnings', 
				format   => \&AnyWhereConnect_output,
	);

	sub AnyWhereConnect_output {
					my $ev = shift;
					# in this registry meat is in the Strings field
					if (defined $ev->{'Strings'}) {$ev->{'Strings'} =~ s/\n/ /g;}
					
					return  $ev->{TimeGenerated},"\t",
							scalar localtime($ev->{TimeGenerated}),"\t",
							Win32::Event2Log::num_to_eventtype($ev->{EventType}),"\t",
							$ev->{RecordNumber},"\t",
							$ev->{Strings}."\n";
	}

	$engine->start;


=head1 caveats

When many many entries had to be read and written back and the time needed to do so exceeds what 
specified as C<interval> it may happens that last numbers are no correctly written to the file C<lastreadfile>
I'm investigating this issue happened rarely in a very busy server and I'm not sure it depends on my
design or on how C<Storable> works and interacts with the operating system.

Typically this can happen when a registry is parsed for the first time and if you notice duplicate entries in your
destination log you can workaround this misbehaviour running the first time your program with a short
value for the C<endtime> option, like C< endtime =E<gt> time + 10> a distinct log for your rule, as
C< log =E<gt> 'previous_entries' > but, very important, leaving untouched C<lastreadfile> so next run of your
program will read just new entries.
