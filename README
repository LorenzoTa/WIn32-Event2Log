Win32-Event2Log

This module uses Win32::EventLog and parses windows events and write them to plain logfiles.
This module is rule based: a rule it's a minimal set of conditions to be met to write an entry to a logfile.
You must add valid rules before starting the engine.
Once started, the engine will check events every x seconds (specified using C<interval> argument)
and for every registry (System, Application, Security, Installation or a user defined one) that is requested
at least in one rule will check for an event's source specified and optionally for some text contained in the
event's description. If the rule it's successful then an entry it's wrote in the specified logfile.
A custom callback can transofrm the line to be wrote using the C<format> option.
The engine can optionally shutdown itself if endtime it is specified.
